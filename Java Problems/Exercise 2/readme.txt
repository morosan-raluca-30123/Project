Exercise 1

Create a Java program that simulates a simple student grade management system using a list and a custom class. 
The system should be able to store a student's name, ID, and their grades for multiple subjects 
(use a HashMap<String, Integer>, grade by subject name). 
It should also be able to perform the following operations:

1. Add a student to the list.
2. Remove a student from the list.
3. Update a student's information.
4. Calculate the average grade of a student.
5. Display the list of students.
